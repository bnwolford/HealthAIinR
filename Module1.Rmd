## Module 1: Introduction to R

* Basics of R programming
* Understanding the RStudio IDE
* RMarkdown for reproducible research

Content for this Module is derived from

* https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/04_introR_packages.html

### R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

### Defining variables
R has five basic or “atomic” classes of objects:
- character
- numeric (real numbers)
- integer
- complex
- logical (True/False)

```{r}

x<-5
class(x)

#we can coerce an object from one class to another
y<-as.integer(x)
class(y)

z<-1L
class(z)
```

The most basic type of R object is a vector. Vectors can only contain objects of the same class. A list is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes.
```{r}

#initialize a vector
a<-vector("numeric",10)
print(a)

#define a vector with c() function
b<-c(1,2,3)
print(b)
class(a)
class(b)

#create a data frame
x<-1:10
y<-rnorm(10)
df<-data.frame(x,y)

```


### Libraries and functions
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages on CRAN. The directories in R where the packages are stored are called the libraries.

```{r}

#what libraries are loaded in the environment?
sessionInfo()

#let's install a package
install.packages("ggplot2")

#now we call the package
library(ggplot2)

#now we can use functions from the ggplot2 package
ggplot(df,aes(x,y)) + geom_point()

```
