MIMIC-III is a freely accesisble critical care database. MIMIC stands for â€˜Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care. This was [published in 2016.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635)
We are using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database Demo. It is downloadable from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/), but I've already put it on HUNT Cloud.

The newest data set, [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/), is also avaialble for certain users that sign the data use agreement and document human ethics training.
