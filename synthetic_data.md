The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset is a large, de-identified and publicly-available collection of medical records. This was [published in 2016.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635)
We are using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database Demo which is open access. It is downloadable from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/), but I've already put it on HUNT Cloud. It is only for 100 patients, so we have a situation with  "big-p, little-n”  denoted as p >> n which means there are many more predictors than samples in the data.

The newest data set, [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/), is also avaialble for certain users that sign the data use agreement and document human ethics training. Physionet calls this "Credientialed Access."
