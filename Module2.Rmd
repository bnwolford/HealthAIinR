## Module 2: Data Handling in R

This lesson is based on content from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html).

First, we need to load in the libraries we will use.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
#The tidyverse package is an “umbrella-package” that installs several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such as tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble, etc.
```

Now, let's read in our data. I like to use the data.table package which has a function `fread()`. However, you can also use base r function  `read_csv()`. 

```{r} 

my_data<-read_csv(file="path/inflammation-01.csv",header=FALSE)

#what do you think the header option does? how can we find out? what would happen if we did not use it?

```
