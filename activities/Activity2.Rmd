## Activity 2

Use information from previous modules to start analyzing a new large dataset. We've downloaded Artificial data from the UK National Healthcare System from this [website](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/artificial-data)

Your objective is to perform exploratory data analysis with the artificial data, which is very like real sensitive data, and use some classic statistical methods.

```{r}

##call libraries
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)


#remember to make this path make sense efor the working directory you are currently in
data_dir<-"artificial_hes_apc_0102.csv"

#read in .csv
df<-read_csv(data_dir)

glimpse(df)

#make a smaller dataset to work with
sub<-df %>% select(DIAG_3_01, ADMIDATE, DISDATE,PSEUDO_HESID,MYDOB, SEX)

#calculate number of days someone was admitted
sub<-sub %>% 
  mutate(duration=as.numeric(DISDATE-ADMIDATE))

#### pre processing


#### use lm() to perform linear regression

#### use tidymodels to perform linear regression
