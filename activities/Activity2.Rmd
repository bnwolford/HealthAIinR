## Activity 2

Use information from previous modules to start analyzing a new large dataset. We've downloaded Artificial data from the UK National Healthcare System from this [website](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/artificial-data)

Your objective is to perform exploratory data analysis with the artificial data, which is very like real sensitive data, and use some classic statistical methods.

```{r}

##call libraries
library(c(dplyr,tidyr,readr,ggplot2))

#remember to replace $USER

#set directory path
data_dir<-"/mnt/work/workbench/$USER/artificial_hes_apc_202302_v1_sample/artificial_hes_apc_0102.csv"

#read in .csv
df<-read_csv(data_dir)

glimpse(df)

#make a smaller dataset to work with; for example:
sub<-df %>% select(DIAG_3_01, ADMIDATE, DISDATE,PSEUDO_HESID,MYDOB, SEX)

glimpse(sub)

```
