## Additional data set for analysis

Use information from Module 1 and Module 2 to read in sensitive data 

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset is a large, de-identified and publicly-available collection of medical records. This was published in 2016. We are using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database Demo which is open access. It is downloadable from PhysioNet, but I've already put it on HUNT Cloud. It is only for 100 patients, so we have a situation with "big-p, little-n” denoted as p >> n which means there are many more predictors than samples in the data.

The newest data set, MIMIC-IV, is also available for certain users that sign the data use agreement and document human ethics training. Physionet calls this "Credientialed Access."


```{r}
##call libraries
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)

data_dir<-"/path/to/MIMIC/"

#read in PATIENTS.csv
patdat<-fread(paste0(data_dir,"PATIENTS.csv"))

head(patdat)

#key for all diagnoses
diagnoses<-fread(paste0(data_dir,"D_ICD_DIAGNOSES.csv"))

#patient diagnoses
diagdat<-fread(paste0(data_dir,"DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv"))
```

In the future, you may be interested in using synthetic data which avoids some of the limitations and restrictions of senstiive data. You may be interested in [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea). This is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. The goal is to output synthetic, realistic (but not real), patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.
