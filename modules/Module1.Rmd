## Module 1: Introduction to R

* Basics of R programming
* Understanding the RStudio IDE
* RMarkdown for reproducible research

Content for this Module is derived from
* https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/r-nuts-and-bolts.html
* https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/04_introR_packages.html

### R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

### Defining variables
R has five basic or “atomic” classes of objects:
- character
- numeric (real numbers)
- integer
- complex
- logical (True/False)

```{r}

x<-5
class(x)

#we can coerce an object from one class to another
y<-as.integer(x)
class(y)

z<-1L
class(z)
```

It is important that we name variables in a way that other users and our future selves will understand.  Today, most R programmers 1) start variable names with lower case letters, 2) separate words in variable names with underscores, and 3) use only lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers in variable names. The [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html) includes a section on this.

The most basic type of R object is a vector. Vectors can only contain objects of the same class. A list is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes.

```{r}

#initialize a vector
a<-vector("numeric",10)
print(a)

#define a vector with c() function
b<-c(1,2,3)
print(b)
class(a)
class(b)

#create a data frame
x<-1:10
y<-rnorm(10)
df<-data.frame(x,y)

```


### Libraries and functions
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages on CRAN. The directories in R where the packages are stored are called the libraries.

```{r}

#what libraries are loaded in the environment?
sessionInfo()

#let's install a package
if(!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}

#now we call the package
library(ggplot2)

#now we can use functions from the ggplot2 package
ggplot(df,aes(x,y)) + geom_point()

```

[Object-oriented programming](https://www.turing.com/kb/object-oriented-programming-help-the-developers-to-code-better) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of breaking down a problem or system into objects.

[Functional programming](https://www.turing.com/kb/introduction-to-functional-programming) is a declarative programming paradigm style where one applies pure functions in sequence to solve complex problems. Functions take an input value and produce an output value without being affected by the program.

R lends itself well to a style of problem solving centered on functions so it can be used as a [functional language](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html). However, [object orienting programm](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html) is also possible in R, using the S3 system for example. These are more advanced computer science concepts which aren't required to understand, but are good to be aware of.
