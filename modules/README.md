# Set up

1. Visit https://healthai-course-2025.lab.hdc.ntnu.no/ in Google Chrome. Use your username and password to logon.  
2. Select Terminal on the second row from the bottom.  
3. When Terminal opens, you are in your workbench folder.  

Clone the github repository by copying the following command into the terminal and press enter.  

```
git clone https://github.com/bnwolford/HealthAIinR.git
```  

4. If you need to get back to your workbench folder at any time, use the next command to change directory. Replace `$USER` with your username.  

```
cd /mnt/work/workbench/$USER/
```  

5. Press the blue plus sign on the top left. A new launcher appears. Now select RStudio, the blue circle with a white R.
6. In the bottom left panel you can navigate the file system like in a regular computer. Select workbench, then HealthAIinR, then modules. Click on Module0.Rmd. This is an R Markdown document. It will open in the top left of the screen.

# Module 0
An introduction to R and Unix. Designed to run each block interactively in RStudio rather than knit the whole document together. In the sections that are grey and start with ```{r} these are code blocks of the document. Hit the green play button to execute the code in that block. Read through and try to understand what is happening.
