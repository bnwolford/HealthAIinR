## Module 3: Data visualization with ggplot2

### Objectives
By the end of this session, learners will be able to:
	*	Understand the grammar of graphics
	*	Create basic visualizations using ggplot2
	*	Customize aesthetics, labels, and themes
	*	Use facet_wrap() to explore subgroups
	
### Introduction

The "gg" in `ggplot2` stands for grammar of graphics. The plots are built in layers and you can additively string together functions with `+` to add layers and customize your plots. The key part of making our plot is to tell ggplot how we want to visually represent the data. We do this by adding a new layer to the plot using one of the geom functions.

```{r}

#read in the data we used in Module 2

username<-"YOUR USERNAME HERE"
path<-paste0("/mnt/work/workbench/",username,"/scratch/",username,"/data/")
path2<-paste0(path,"sample.csv")



# Start with the dataset and aesthetic mapping

#Nothing appears — because no geometric layer is added yet!

# Add a geometric layer: scatter plot

#the plot will show up on the bottom right of your RStudio IDE


```

# Common plots

Histograms visualize the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing its range into consecutive intervals called bins and then counting the number of observations that fall into each bin. By default, `geom_histogram()` has 30 bins. Binwidth controls the width of the bins (or bars) along the x-axis. The binwidth argument directly specifies the size of these intervals. For example, if your x-axis represents age in years and you set binwidth = 5, each bar in the histogram will represent a 5-year age range.

`ggplot` has many themes that allow for publication ready plots. You can tweak the display of existing themes or make your own.
Read more [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). 

```{r}

# Let's make a histogram

# Let's customize the histogram with arguments for bin width and color


# Bar plot for categorical data; geom_bar uses counts by default; now we add a theme for a nicer presentation


```

### Boxplots

```{r}

# boxplots show the median and interquartile range of a distribution


# we can also show the raw data points underlying the distributions by layering on geom_point()


# It’s important to note that each layer is drawn on top of the previous layer, so we have to pay attention to order.
#In this example, the boxplot has been drawn on top of the points. This doesn't really represent the data well.


# geom_jitter() is a common way to present a box plot and the raw data


# Violin plots are also a way to show the distribution of the data in addition to the raw data and the quartiles



# Now let's add some color and set a theme; note we have to add a fill aesthetic



# Using fill created a legend (by default on the right side of the plot), but we don't need that since the x-axis is also labelled, let's drop it

# Let's rename the x-axis since it defaulted to the name of our variable; let's also spell out Female and Male
# let's also make the violin look a little nicer with trim=FALSE

                                 
# What if we want to stratify by the Treatment Group? Note we bring back the legend by changing that theme layer


# R will use a default color palette, but we can also customize this; notice this time we use scale_color_manual instead of scale_fill_manual
# Two different grouping variables are used: Sex on x-axis and Group as line color (legend variable).
# The space between the grouped plots is adjusted using the function position_dodge().



# Alternatively, we can use facets to stratify the data


# The facet_wrap layer took a “formula” as its argument, denoted by the tilde (~). This tells R to draw a panel for each unique value in the Group column.

```



### Exporting the plot

The `ggsave()` function allows you to export a plot created with ggplot. You can specify the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (width, height and dpi) to create high quality graphics for publication. 

I also like to use base-r functions `pdf()` and `png()`. These function serves as a graphics device driver, allowing you to direct plots generated in R to a PDF or png file. You use it in conjunction with dev.off() to open and then close the file for writing.

```{r}

#set a path to save the file to
username<-"YOUR USERNAME HERE"
output_path<-paste0("/mnt/work/workbench/",username,"/scratch/",username,"/test_plot.png")

#approach 1

#approach 2




# if you are in the working directory where you want to save the plot, you can just put a string in the function instead of the variable representing an absolute path

```

### Resources

There are a lot of online resources for customizing data visualization. A few that we recommend:
1) https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html
2) https://r-graphics.org/
3) https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

### Challenge

Task: Given a data frame of patients' inflammatory measures over time, create a plot that shows these measurements over time, stratified by patient
	0. Read in the data with `read_csv`
	1. Use `mutate()` to add a sample ID column
	2. Turn the data from wide to long with `pivot_longer()`
	3. Turn the column that represents time points into numeric
	4. Create a line plot `ggplot2`; inflammation should be on the y-axis, timepoint should be on the x-axis. Use `facet_wrap()` to separate by sample ID.
	5. Export the plot with `ggsave()`

```{r}

#define the path to the data
username<-"YOUR USERNAME HERE"
path<-paste0("/mnt/work/workbench/",username,"/scratch/",username,"/data/")
path2<-paste0(path,"inflammation-01.csv")

#read in the inflammation data as a tibble


# use mutate to create a sample ID column


# use pivot_longer to restructure the data



# turn the timepoint column from character to numeric
# HINT mutate(timepoint_num=as.numeric(sub("^X", "", timepoint)))

#create a plot with one line per sample

#export the plot with ggsave()

#set a path to save the file to
username<-"YOUR USERNAME HERE"
output_path<-paste0("/mnt/work/workbench/",username,"/scratch/",username,"/inflammation.png")
## put ggsave() call here


```
